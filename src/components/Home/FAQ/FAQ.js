			<h2>Why this project ?</h2>
			<p>Honestly, the goal is just to practice React. But I think it can be useful for some people. And I use personaly Playground of OpenAI a lot of time so I think it can be nice to have more functionnalities like :</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your own API Key (No Subscription needed)</li>
				<li>GPT3.5 and GPT4</li>
				<li>Dark mode and better UX</li>
				<li>Stored history</li>
				<li>Create your own presets</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Don't hesitate to open an issue if you have a suggestion.</p>

			<h2>How to use it ?</h2>
			<p>Wait, my project is not finish yet.</p>

			{/* ===========================
