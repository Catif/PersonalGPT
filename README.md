# PersonalGPT

This is a web app create with React. It is a simple web app that allows you to chat with GPT3.5 or GPT4 with your own API key.

## Why this project ?

Honestly, the goal is just to learn React. But I think it can be useful for some people. And I use personaly Playground of OpenAI a lot of time.

Basicaly :

- use your own API Key (No Subscription needed like ChatGPT or other web app)
- Open Source
- GPT3.5 and GPT4 compatible
- History of your conversation
- Create your own presets
- **NO DATA COLLECTED** (I use localStorage to save your history and your presets)
