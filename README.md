# PersonalGPT

This is a web app create with Vue 3. It is a simple web app that allows you to chat with GPT3.5 or GPT4 with your own API key.

## Why this project ?

Honestly, the goal is just a practice API and CSS. But I think it can be useful for some people. And I use personaly Playground of OpenAI a lot of time so I think it can be nice to have more functionnalities like :

- Your own API Key (No Subscription needed)
- GPT3.5 and GPT4
- Dark mode and better UX
- Stored history
- Create your own presets
